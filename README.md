Expression Guest Registry is designed to help funeral directors easily capture information on people attending a service. This innovative digital guest registry stores the names, addresses and emails of friends and family of the deceased, and allows the funeral home to use its current printing system and stock, without any additional fees.  Visitors can also contribute to the family's memorial fund with a credit or debit card... providing a modern-day option to cash and checks.  By offering the Expression Guest Registry, your firm is providing a valuable service for your families and, more importantly, building new relationships in your community.
